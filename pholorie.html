                            <li>In a mini food processor blend together cilantro, parsley, garlic, onions and scotch bonnet pepper until puree. If you do not have a processor finely chop the ingredients and smash using a motor and pestle or rolling pin. If you have green seasoning use about 2 Tablespoons instead.</li>
                            <li>In A large bowl combine all ingredients except the water ; flour split pea and all-purpose, yeast, salt sugar cumin, turmeric, curry, onion mix and yeast. Thoroughly mix.</li>
                            <li>Then add warm water a little at a time until you get to desired consistency – like thick pancake batter. I usually use about 1 1/3 cup . Thoroughly mix preferable with your hands.</li>
                            <li>Set the mixture in a warm area and let it rise and double in size -approximately 1- 2 hours</li>
                            <li>In a large, sauce pan pour vegetable oil, until it is at least 3 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter balls), and place on medium heat until oil is about 375 degrees.</li>
                            <li>The dough is going to be slightly sticky so use your hands to grab a little bit of mixture at time and drop in the oil or use a spoon to spoon up the batter, and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil, sort of in the shape of a ball. Do not overcrowd the pan. Do so in batches</li>
                            <li>Fry for a few minutes (about 7 minutes or more until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is slightly golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.</li>
